"""Helpers for computing on every canopy layer slot of one patch (``clm_ml.state.PatchLayers``).

Profiles have ``max_layers`` slots on axis 0 (0-based). Processes compute on every slot and
keep results where a mask is true, so one compiled program serves any layer counts. Padding
slots first take the top layer's inputs (:func:`pad_with_top`): the top layer is above the
canopy and leafless, so padding computes a harmless leafless layer instead of arithmetic on
fill values (which would give infinities and NaN gradients even though the results are
discarded). Same rules as the legacy ``multilayer_canopy.MLLayersMod`` had (1-based slots).
