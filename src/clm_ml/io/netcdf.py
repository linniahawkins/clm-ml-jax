"""One lock for every netCDF read and write in this process.

The forcing for the next chunk is read on a background thread while the output files of the
current one are written on the main thread (``clm_ml.driver.run_streams``). The HDF5 library
under netCDF4 is built without thread safety here (its build settings say "Threadsafety: no")
and netCDF4-python releases the GIL inside library calls, so two threads could be inside HDF5
at once. Every netCDF file is therefore opened through :func:`dataset` (or written under
:data:`LOCK`): reads and writes never overlap, while the device still runs the chunk during a
read (open item O31, decision 100).
