"""
Forcing: one chunk of everything prescribed from outside the model.

A run reads its forcing a chunk at a time (modernization plan §6.9), so memory depends on
the chunk length, not the run length. A chunk of ``n_steps`` model steps holds
``n_steps + 2`` records along its time axis: one **halo** record before the first step, the
steps themselves, and one halo record after the last step. The halos are the neighbouring
records the three-point time interpolation needs at the chunk edges. At the very start and
end of a run there is no neighbour, so the halo repeats the edge record, as the Fortran
driver does (``*_bef`` seeded with the current forcing; ``itim_next = min(itim+1, ntim)``).

Meteorology is per gridcell, shape ``(time, gridcell)``; CLM history data (leaf/stem area
and soil water) is per patch/column, shape ``(time, patch)`` / ``(time, column, layer)``.
Wavebands are ``(vis, nir)``.

``Forcing`` holds arrays only: no files are opened while a chunk runs. It is built by
:func:`clm_ml.legacy.forcing.load_forcing`, which applies the same derivations as the
Fortran ``TowerMetMod`` (humidity from relative humidity, longwave from emissivity, solar
partitioning).
