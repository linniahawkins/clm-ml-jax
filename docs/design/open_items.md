# Open items: tasks, decisions and issues

One list of everything still open after Phase 7, gathered from the design documents
(`global_input.md`, `phase6_progress.md`, `phase7_scope.md`, `phase7_progress.md`,
`phase7_decisions.md`, `modernization_plan.md`, `numerics_and_regression.md`, `timing.md`),
CLAUDE.md, the code, and the Phase 8 survey. Each item keeps its original IDs under
"Source" so its history can be traced. Items appearing in several places are merged.

**Status (2026-11-01): Phase 8 closed** (8b reduced to a README, one docs page and two
examples: decision 103); the documentation items are Phase 9, scoped in `phase9_scope.md`.

**Targets:** **8a** = housekeeping before the documentation; **9** = documentation and
release (was 8b; decision 103); **after 8** = after Phase 8 (already planned that way); **known** = a known model
limitation, not to be changed without discussion. **Decides:** **M** = maintainer (science
or project choice); **I** = implementation (can be done without a science decision, reviewed
as usual).

**How to use:** IDs are stable (never renumber). A new item gets the next free ID, in its
group and in the summary table. When an item is settled, move it to "Recently closed" with
the commit and, if a decision was made, its number in [`decisions.md`](decisions.md).
The model as it is now: [`model_overview.md`](model_overview.md).

## 1. Science issues needing the maintainer's decision

### O1. Soil texture class looked up one class too far
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** fixed (decision 92; `tests/clm_ml/test_setup_soil.py`).
- **Kind:** science issue (translation bug) · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** a tower given only `texture_class` (no sand/clay percentages) gets the next
  class's sand, clay and Clapp-Hornberger values ("loam" gets "sandy clay loam"), and
  "clay" (class 11) crashes with an index error. Fortran indexes 1-based arrays, so it has
  no shift. Wrong soil hydraulic and thermal properties for those towers.
- **Now:** kept bit for bit in `clm_ml.setup.soil.soil_properties` (docstring flags it,
  `src/clm_ml/setup/soil.py:88`). CHATS7 and grid runs give percentages: not affected.
- **Next:** fix (index `tex - 1`), add a test with "loam" and "clay"; changes only those
  towers' soils.
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 21; C27; Phase 7 "Next".

### O2. Missing `organic_matter` gives a negative organic fraction
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** domain.yaml requires `organic_matter` (decision 93): a missing value
  can no longer reach the -999 path (grid runs always read it from the surface data).
- **Kind:** science issue (bug) · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** towers.yaml allows `organic_matter: null`; it becomes -999, and the setup
  divides by 130 kg m⁻³ (`om_frac` = -7.7), so porosity, suction, b, conductivities and
  heat capacity are extrapolated far outside their range.
- **Now:** kept bit for bit (`src/clm_ml/setup/patches.py:83`). CHATS7 (50 kg m⁻³) and
  grid runs (surface data) not affected.
- **Next:** choose: 0 (mineral soil) or an error asking for a value.
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 22; C27; Phase 7 "Next".

### O3. Soil ice read one level too deep in `SoilResistance`
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** fixed: the level's own ice (`step.soil_level_ice`; decision 95; bit for bit while soil water is all liquid).
- **Kind:** science issue (latent bug) · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** Fortran stops root uptake from a level holding ice; the JAX code tests the ice
  of the level below. No effect today (ice is always 0, see O9); would matter once frozen
  soil is represented.
- **Now:** kept (`src/clm_ml/step.py:290`, comment cites C14).
- **Next:** one index; bit for bit while ice is 0.
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 19; C14; C21.

### O4. Fortran's checks of the implicit flux-profile solution are not run
- **Kind:** science issue (checking) · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** Fortran `ErrorCheck01/02` stop the run if the implicit solution disagrees with
  the leaf and soil fluxes or does not conserve energy and water vapor (15 checks). No JAX
  run has ever checked them.
- **Now:** `clm_ml.processes.flux_profile.implicit_errors` computes all 15 and a unit test
  runs them; they are not in `BALANCE_CHECKS`.
- **Next:** decide whether every run records them (the state's `balance_error` grows; the
  reference is re-recorded).
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 20; C17.

### O5. Solver stopping rules differ from Fortran
- **Kind:** science issue (fidelity) · **Target:** decide in 8a, fix after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** three iterative solvers differ from Fortran's algorithms: Obukhov length (25
  fixed secant steps vs Fortran's secant/Brent hybrid, tol 0.1 m); stomatal conductance for
  WUE (20 halvings plus a Newton step vs Fortran's bisection to 0.001 mol m⁻² s⁻¹, so gs
  differs by up to ~1e-2 relative); intercellular CO₂ for Medlyn/Ball-Berry (40 secant steps
  plus Newton vs hybrid, tol 0.1). All within the validated agreement (CHATS7 ≤ 2.5 %).
- **Now:** unchanged since before the modernization; recorded as known deviations.
- **Next:** decide: keep (more converged, differentiable) and document, or a fidelity step
  matching Fortran's stopping rules (validated against Fortran; a science change).
- **Source:** `numerics_and_regression.md` §4.1-4.3; CLAUDE.md "Iterative solvers".

### O6. Transpiration and canopy-evaporation latent heat outputs use the last sub-step's latent heat
- **Deferred 2026-11-01:** deferred to after Phase 8 (maintainer): the two outputs keep Fortran's form (step-averaged water flux times the last sub-step's latent heat) and differ from `latent_heat_flux`'s sub-step accumulation (decision 32) only on steps where the air crosses 0 °C; to be documented in 8b as a known difference.
- **Kind:** science issue (diagnostic consistency) · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** decision 32 fixed the canopy-top latent heat (averaged sub-step by sub-step).
  The outputs `transpiration_latent_heat_flux` and `canopy_evaporation_latent_heat_flux`
  (and the legacy `.out` writer) still multiply the averaged water flux by the last
  sub-step's latent heat: slightly inconsistent on steps where the air crosses 0 °C. Not in
  any check; CHATS7 never crosses freezing.
- **Now:** unchanged.
- **Next:** decide whether to apply decision 32's treatment to these outputs too.
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 12 ("Still using the last sub-step's latent heat").

### O7. LAI and SAI gradients have a kink at the minimum plant area
- **Kind:** science issue (differentiability) · **Target:** after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** in a layer held at 0.01 m² m⁻² (decision 30), the layer's total plant area does
  not respond to LAI or SAI, and the slope changes where a layer crosses the floor; the
  gradient with respect to SAI is zero in floored layers. Matters for calibration and
  sensitivity with respect to LAI/SAI.
- **Now:** the floor as decided (decision 30).
- **Next:** a smooth alternative would change forward values near the threshold: science
  choice. Related to O54 (bare ground).
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 17b; decision 30.

### O8. Minimum plant area protects radiation only for clumping above ~0.55
- **Kind:** science issue · **Target:** after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** the 0.01 m² m⁻² floor keeps the diffuse transmittance below 1 only when
  `clumping_index` is above ~0.55. All built-in PFTs use 1.0, but a calibration could push
  it lower and bring back the runaway leaf temperatures of issue 14.
- **Now:** not guarded.
- **Next:** decide: bound the parameter, or a radiation formulation that stays well
  conditioned (see O54 option 1).
- **Source:** Phase 6 review R10; `global_input.md` issue 14.

### O9. Frozen soil: all prescribed soil water is liquid
- **Kind:** science issue · **Target:** after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** `H2OSOI` is total water; CLM-ml puts it all in liquid, so frozen soils supply
  liquid water to roots and have the thermal properties of wet unfrozen soil. CLM keeps the
  model's ice fraction (`SOILLIQ`, `SOILICE` are in the history files).
- **Now:** ice always 0 (as Fortran CLM-ml).
- **Next:** science change for global/cold sites; also activates O3.
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 3.

### O10. No snowpack on the ground
- **Kind:** science issue · **Target:** after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** snowfall is intercepted by the canopy but snow reaching the ground is not
  accumulated: no change of ground albedo, ground heat flux or LAI burial.
- **Now:** no snow model (towers: snowfall 0, as Fortran).
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 4.

### O11. Root biomass 500 g m⁻² everywhere; canopy bottom height unused (grid runs)
- **Kind:** science issue · **Target:** after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** satellite phenology has no fine-root biomass, so every grid patch uses
  500 g m⁻² (CLM-ml's forest-tower value). `MONTHLY_HEIGHT_BOT` is read but the leaf
  profile still runs from the ground to the top.
- **Now:** `domain.grid.root_biomass` (500); `Patches.canopy_bottom` kept, unused.
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 5, G13, G17.

### O12. Initial state from monthly means, not a spun-up restart (grid runs)
- **Kind:** science issue · **Target:** after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** grid runs start from interpolated monthly `TSOI`/`H2OSOI`; expect a soil
  temperature drift over the first weeks.
- **Now:** as G11.
- **Next:** spin-up procedure (restarts exist since 7.5) or a CLM restart reader.
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 6, G11.

### O13. Forcing height fixed at setup; CLM6 roughness is Meier2022
- **Kind:** science issue · **Target:** after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** CLM6 computes `z0m` and displacement from LAI each step (so its forcing height
  varies in time); this model fixes the forcing height at setup with the ZengWang2007 rule
  (decision 2 of `global_input.md`).
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 1, G14.

### O14. Very short canopies not filtered
- **Kind:** science issue · **Target:** after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** grass and crop tops go down to 5 mm in the surface data, still given 10 + 10
  layers.
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 9.

### O15. Wet needleleaf canopies
- **Kind:** science issue (observation) · **Target:** after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** CLM6's needleleaf `dleaf` is 0.65 mm (CLM5: 4 cm); the leaf boundary-layer
  conductance grows as `dleaf` shrinks. South-eastern US needleleaf patches have January
  latent heat 16 W m⁻² (others 6.9), with wet days of 150-226 W m⁻² fed by negative
  sensible heat. To compare with CLM. Also the patch most sensitive in O53.
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 15, issue 10.

### O16. CO₂ profile reset covers the wrong levels (no effect today)
- **Kind:** science issue (latent) · **Target:** after 8 · **Decides:** M
- **What:** Fortran resets `cair` to the reference CO₂ in canopy layers 1…ncan; the
  translation reset levels 0…ncan−1. No effect: `cair` is never computed (no CO₂ profile).
- **Now:** kept through Phase 7 (0-based: layers 0…ncan−2, the top layer not reset;
  `src/clm_ml/processes/canopy.py:843`); fix with any change that makes `cair` vary.
- **Source:** `numerics_and_regression.md` §4.5.

## 2. Other maintainer decisions pending

### O17. Repository organization: where the real configuration files live
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** `configs/` with complete, generated model.yaml files (decision 90);
  params files complete, no `extends`, `run.yaml` must name one (decision 89). Kept below
  as it was found.
- **Kind:** maintainer decision · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** a user cannot find "the" CHATS7 configuration. Today:
  - **model.yaml:** no file in the repo is used by the model; the defaults are in the code
    (`clm_ml/config.py` dataclasses; `model: null` in run.yaml means all defaults). Example
    files are in `docs/design/examples/` (`model.yaml`, `model_grid.yaml`), and `clm-ml
    convert` writes one (only `canopy_layers.min_plant_area_per_layer`).
  - **params.yaml:** built-in sets in the package, `src/clm_ml/data/params/`
    (`clm5_defaults.yaml`, `chats.yaml` = CHATS overrides via `extends`, `clm6.yaml`); an
    excerpt and a CHATS example in `docs/design/examples/`.
  - **towers.yaml:** built-in `src/clm_ml/data/towers.yaml` (CHATS7 only); example in
    `docs/design/examples/towers_example.yaml`.
  - **run.yaml:** none committed for CHATS7 except `docs/design/examples/run_chats7_1day.yaml`;
    the tests and CI create them with `clm-ml convert` from `data/namelists/`.
  - **Input data:** `data/input_files/` (Fortran's layout, `clm5_0/` kept by C35); plan 7b
    wanted `examples/data/` (not done).
- **Next:** decide the layout, e.g. a top-level `configs/` (or `examples/`) with validated,
  commented CHATS7 run/model files that CI runs `clm-ml check` on (jax-gcm's "named config
  files"), the package data staying the built-in defaults; design examples kept as history
  or removed.
- **Source:** maintainer question (2026-11-01); plan §4, plan 7b; Phase 7 "Not done"; C33.

### O18. Norman and well-mixed code in git history only
- **Kind:** maintainer decision · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** D8 said WellMixed, dataset profiles and Norman solar radiation stay "kept,
  registered as unsupported". The options are registered and refused with a clear error,
  but their translations went with the containers in 7.4f (git history, commit `1f1b651`).
- **Next:** accept (code from history when the variants are redone, O56) or restore as
  reference files that do not run.
- **Source:** C34; D8; C13, C17.

### O19. Options that only ever refuse
- **Kind:** maintainer decision · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** D9 kept `gs_solver` (`wue_solver: brent`) and `mlcan_to_clm`. Both now refuse
  their non-default value (`run.py:551`; `driver.py:360`); `mlcan_to_clm` is not a model.yaml
  key, only an `MLOptions` field (`options.py:43`).
- **Next:** keep (documented as planned variants) or remove until implemented.
- **Source:** D9; C16; C21; `global_input.md` issue 18.

### O20. `nitrogen_decay_kn` is static, not differentiable
- **Kind:** maintainer decision · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** the canopy nitrogen decay coefficient (`kn_val`) is a model.yaml option, so it
  cannot be calibrated with gradients, against the design rule "every numeric tunable must
  be differentiable".
- **Next:** decide whether to move it to params.yaml (per PFT) as a differentiable
  parameter (interface change; bit for bit for the default).
- **Source:** C18; `config.py:34`; CLAUDE.md design guidance.

### O21. Public API
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** the five names `load_experiment`, `new_experiment`, `upgrade_experiment`, `Experiment`, `Model` (decision 96; `tests/clm_ml/test_public_api.py`).
- **Kind:** maintainer decision · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** `clm_ml/__init__.py` exports nothing; users must import internal modules
  (`clm_ml.run.load_run`, `clm_ml.model.Model`, `clm_ml.config.ModelConfig`,
  `clm_ml.params.Params`). Documentation fixes what is public.
- **Next:** choose the public names (compare `docs/design/api_sketch.py`), re-export them,
  test the imports.
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey; plan §5.

### O22. Review of Phase 7 behaviour changes and re-recorded references
- **Kind:** maintainer decision · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** the maintainer's review of Phase 7 is pending: round-off-only reference
  re-recordings (C10, C14, C16, C17, C19-C21, C28); behaviour changes beyond round-off
  (chunks counted from step 0, restart format 6 netCDF, `ModelError` instead of
  `SystemExit`, health check by layer masks: C28, C32; CLM history validation and soil
  colour 0 refused: C31; raw validation fields renamed: C33; `clm-ml-offline` retired: C30);
  28 + 27 diagnostics no longer computed (`phase7_removed_diagnostics.md`; C19, C20).
- **Next:** accept, or name what to revisit.
- **Source:** `phase7_progress.md` "Next" and "Open for the maintainer".

### O23. Authorship, citation and canonical repository
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** Linnia Hawkins (lead) and Aya Lahlou; canonical repository linniahawkins/clm-ml-jax; CITATION.cff, README, pyproject, LICENSE (decision 97).
- **Kind:** maintainer decision · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** README badges, codecov, the citation ("Lahlou, Aya, 2024") and CONTRIBUTING's
  clone URL point to `AyaLahlou/clm-ml-jax`; the remote is `linniahawkins/clm-ml-jax`.
- **Next:** decide authors, canonical repo, licence holders (LICENSE is BSD-3).
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey.

### O24. Release logistics
- **Decided 2026-11-01:** decision 98: `main` fast-forwarded to the phase branch when 8a closes; version 1.0.0 tagged at the end of 8b; GitHub release only, no PyPI for now.
- **Kind:** maintainer decision · **Target:** 8a (merge), 9 (release; decision 103) · **Decides:** M
- **What:** `origin/main` (2026-05-26) is 156 commits behind `phase7/restructure`; no phase
  branch has been merged (plan risk "Every phase is merged on its own" not followed;
  standing rule: no PRs). Version is 0.1.0.
- **Next:** decide how `main` is updated (local merge and push, authorized explicitly), the
  1.0.0 tag, PyPI or GitHub only.
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey; plan §9; plan Phase 8.

## 3. Bugs and robustness

### O25. XLA CPU gradient crash
- **Kind:** bug (upstream, JAX 0.9.2) · **Target:** known; recheck at each JAX upgrade · **Decides:** I
- **What:** running compiled CPU gradients segfaults in LLVM-optimized code. Workaround:
  CPU gradient tests with LLVM optimization off (`tests/gradient_tier.py`); GPU gradients
  pass.
- **Next:** report upstream / retest with newer JAX; document for users computing CPU
  gradients.
- **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 16; D12; CLAUDE.md gotchas.

### O26. XLA CPU compile crash
- **Kind:** bug (upstream, JAX 0.9.2) · **Target:** known; recheck at JAX upgrade · **Decides:** I
- **What:** large batched programs segfaulted while compiling (LLVM JIT linker recursion).
  Workaround: `clm_ml/__init__.py` sets `--xla_cpu_parallel_codegen_split_count=1`.
- **Source:** CLAUDE.md gotchas; `src/clm_ml/__init__.py`.

### O27. GPU compile-to-compile variation
- **Kind:** bug (reproducibility) · **Target:** after 8 (GPU work) · **Decides:** I
- **What:** on the GPU about one fresh compile in five gives a program whose results differ
  by ~1e-11 (within the noise twin). Diagnosis unfinished (setup programs get different
  cache keys in each process). Bit for bit is a CPU-only test.
- **Source:** C4 ("Open"); CLAUDE.md gotchas.

### O28. A failing patch still enters its chunk's gridcell sums
- **Kind:** robustness · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** M
- **What:** with `on_patch_error: exclude`, a patch failing a check with finite values still
  enters the gridcell sums (and parameter gradients) for the chunk in which it fails (10
  days by default); only its patch output is filled.
- **Next:** decide whether that is acceptable (document) or fix (needs per-step exclusion).
- **Source:** Phase 6 review R4; decision 25.

### O29. Padding slots combine one gridcell's weather with another patch's data
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** the proposed fix (decision 101).
- **Kind:** robustness · **Target:** 8a (verify) · **Decides:** I
- **What:** padding slots (for equal device shares) on real gridcells combine one
  gridcell's meteorology with another patch's site data, and stop mode checked them as if
  real. Phase 7's health check by layer masks (C28) may have changed this: verify.
- **Diagnosis (2026-11-01, code reading):** still so. `Simulation.blocked` (multi-device
  runs) fills a device block's empty slots with weight-0 copies of a patch of the same
  pathway but puts them on the block's *last* gridcell, whose weather can differ from the
  copied patch's own gridcell (`padded()`, for `patch_count`, is consistent: the last real
  patch on the last real gridcell's forcing). Weight 0 keeps them out of every gridcell sum
  and gradient; but in stop mode `check_batch` checks every slot, so an unphysical padding
  slot that fails a conservation or health check would stop the run ("padding N"); in exclude
  mode it is excluded quietly (not counted). Only grid runs on several devices (towers on
  several devices must share one meteorology file, R1).
- **Proposed fix:** check only the real slots (`sim.real_index`) in `check_batch` and
  `batch_failures`, and put each padding copy on its source patch's gridcell when that
  gridcell is in the block. Results unchanged.
- **Source:** Phase 6 review R5.

### O30. Smaller Phase 6 review items
- **2026-11-01 (maintainer):** the first-forcing-year item is fixed with CDEPS's rule (decision 102); the per-variable exclusion in `gridcell_sum` and the rest are documented here and fixed after Phase 8.
- **Kind:** robustness · **Target:** 8a (verify each) · **Decides:** I
- **What:** per-variable exclusion in `gridcell_sum`; unmasked first-step gridcell sums
  (the first step is an ordinary step since C28: likely closed); `Model.weights()` in slot
  order with devices > 1; a run starting in the first forcing year cannot start; 184
  gridcells use the nearest point where ESMF may interpolate; R7 (tower setup not bit for
  bit when the porosity cap binds; setup rewritten in 7.4: likely closed).
- **Diagnosis (2026-11-01):**
  - *Per-variable exclusion in `gridcell_sum`* (`driver.py`, `make_runner`): still so. A
    patch is left out of a variable's gridcell sum when that variable is not finite, so in a
    step where a patch has NaN in one output but not another, the gridcell sums of different
    variables use different patches (the energy budget of the gridcell output can then fail
    to close for that step). Such a patch fails its checks in that chunk (stop mode stops;
    exclude mode excludes it from the next chunk). Proposed fix: leave a patch out of all
    sums of a step when any of its outputs is not finite.
  - *Unmasked first-step gridcell sums:* closed (the first step is an ordinary step of the
    first chunk since C28).
  - *`Model.weights()` in slot order with devices > 1:* documented (its docstring says
    "device blocks with execution.devices"; `run_chunk` outputs are in the same order).
    Proposed: document it in 8b.
  - *A grid run cannot start in the first forcing year:* confirmed by a probe (a 1-day grid
    run from 1901-01-01, the first CRUJRA year: "forcing stream: the files do not cover the
    model time"; from 1902-01-01 it reads). The first steps' time interpolation needs the
    record before 1 January. Proposed fix: CDEPS's rule at the edge of the data (datm
    `taxmode`: `extend` uses the first record, `cycle` wraps to the last year): a science
    choice for the maintainer.
  - *184 gridcells use the nearest point where ESMF may interpolate:* unchanged (a
    regridding difference from CTSM's mapping files; listed as a known departure).
  - *R7 (setup not bit for bit when the porosity cap binds):* the setup was rewritten in
    7.4 and `test_setup` compares every constant and the initial state bit for bit; not
    re-checked with a column whose cap binds. Proposed: close, or add such a column to
    `test_setup` in 8b.
- **Source:** Phase 6 review R7, R11.

### O31. netCDF read on a background thread while writing on the main thread
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** the proposed fix (decision 100).
- **Kind:** robustness · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** I
- **What:** the forcing reader thread reads netCDF while the output writers write netCDF on
  the main thread; HDF5 builds without thread safety could crash. As since Phase 4.
- **Diagnosis (2026-11-01):** the risk is real in this environment: the netCDF4 1.7.4 wheel
  bundles HDF5 1.14.6 built with "Threadsafety: no" (its `libhdf5.settings` string), and
  netCDF4-python releases the GIL during library calls (per its release notes; not tested
  here), so the forcing reader thread and the output writers can be inside HDF5 at the
  same time. No crash has been seen (the reader reads while the device runs the chunk; the
  writers write after it), but nothing prevents the overlap when output records complete
  while the next chunk is read.
- **Proposed fix:** one lock (e.g. `clm_ml.io.netcdf_lock`) held by every netCDF read and
  write: reading and writing then never overlap, while the device still runs the chunk
  during the read. Results unchanged.
- **Source:** C31; Phase 7 "Not done".

### O32. `Model.chunks()` start at step 1, runs chunk from step 0
- **Kind:** robustness (API consistency) · **Target:** 8a or document in 8b · **Decides:** M
- **What:** `Model` runs the first step at setup, so its chunks start at step 1; `Run`
  chunks from step 0. A user comparing the two gets an offset.
- **Source:** C31; CLAUDE.md gotchas.

### O33. The `euler` tableau has `b = [0]`
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **Kind:** robustness · **Target:** 8a · **Decides:** I
- **What:** `runge_kutta_update` with the Euler tableau would reset the state; the model is
  right only because `canopy._stage` returns before calling it. A trap for future code.
- **Next:** a correct tableau or an assertion.
- **Source:** C23 (a).

### O71. Forward-mode gradients fail
- **Closed 2026-11-02** (decision 104; see "Recently closed").
- **Kind:** bug (gradients) · **Target:** now, branch `fix/o71-forward-mode` · **Decides:** I
  (approach discussed with the maintainer, 2026-11-02)
- **What:** `jax.jvp` / `jax.jacfwd` through `Model.run_chunk` stop with `TypeError: can't
  apply forward-mode autodiff (jvp) to a custom_vjp function`. The only cause is the coupled
  flux-profile solver `tridiag_2eq` (`src/clm_ml/processes/math.py`), which has a
  hand-written reverse-mode rule (`jax.custom_vjp`; the transpose system solved with the
  same block Thomas algorithm, to avoid differentiating through the elimination). Forward
  mode gives the sensitivity of whole output time series to one parameter or forcing
  direction in one run (reverse mode: one scalar with respect to everything).
- **Diagnosis (2026-11-02, scratch probes, no code change):** every other solver is
  forward-mode safe: the Obukhov secant, the WUE bisection, the ci secant and the roughness
  bisection use `x0 - (step - stop_gradient(step))` (decision 59), and `tridiag` (longwave,
  soil temperature) is differentiated directly. With `tridiag_2eq`'s rule removed, `jvp`
  runs through a 24-step CHATS7 chunk and agrees with `grad` (1e-8 relative) and with a
  centred finite difference (0.6 %, as `grad`).
- **Next:** write `tridiag_2eq` with `jax.lax.custom_linear_solve` (forward solve: the
  Fortran block Thomas algorithm, unchanged; transpose solve: today's backward rule;
  the operator `A x` for the coefficient derivatives). Prototype: forward values bit for
  bit (unit system and the CHATS7 chunk), reverse gradients identical to today's
  (difference 0.0 on a unit system; same digits and speed on the chunk), forward mode
  equal to a dense solve to 3e-16, jvp/vjp dot-product test to 2e-16.
- **Source:** maintainer request (2026-11-02, forward-mode sensitivity runs at CHATS).

### O72. JAX 0.10.2 in the environment; reference and workarounds from 0.9.2
- **Kind:** testing / environment · **Target:** now · **Decides:** M
- **What:** the conda environment `/glade/work/linnia/conda-envs/clm-ml-jax` has JAX and
  jaxlib 0.10.2 (installed 2026-11-01 17:37), and Python 3.11. The regression reference
  (`tests/regression/reference/CHATS7_50steps.npz`) was recorded with JAX 0.9.2 (commit
  dc7ac35). On `main`, unchanged code, the bit-for-bit test fails on 67 of 96 fields (largest
  relative difference 1.9e-9, `diagnostics.shair_profile`); the noise-twin test passes on all
  96. The JAX workarounds in CLAUDE.md and the code (O25 CPU gradient crash, O26 compile
  crash, decision 64's scatter rule) were found with 0.9.2 and were not rechecked.
- **Next:** the maintainer decides: keep 0.10.2 (recheck O25/O26, then regenerate the
  reference with `record_run.py --update-reference`, in its own commit) or pin 0.9.2.
- **Source:** found while testing O71 (2026-11-02).

## 4. Housekeeping and repository organization (8a)

### O34. `.gitignore` ignores `docs/`
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **What:** new documentation files are silently left out of commits (tracked files are
  added with `git add -u docs`/`-f`). It also lists directories that do not exist here
  (`CLM-ml_v1/`, `clubb_ML/`, `jax-agents/`, `Paper/`, `tests/integration/`, ...).
- **Now:** the `docs/` rule removed (2026-11-01, with this document).
- **Next:** prune the rest.
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey; `phase7_progress.md` practical notes.

### O35. Empty `.gitmodules`; CONTRIBUTING describes a submodule
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **What:** CONTRIBUTING says to clone `--recurse-submodules` (Fortran in `CLM-ml_v1/`);
  `.gitmodules` is empty. Fortran sources are outside the repo.
- **Next:** delete `.gitmodules`; say where the Fortran references are.
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey.

### O36. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is stale
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** deleted (decision 99).
- **What:** 491 lines on deleted packages (`clm_src_main`, `clm_varpar`, ...).
- **Next:** delete (CLAUDE.md and CONTRIBUTING cover it) or rewrite.
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey.

### O37. README out of date
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** updated with O23 (decision 97).
- **What:** badges and citation (O23); features list "Namelist-driven configuration"; a
  generic fork/PR contributing section; no mention of grid runs, gradients, restarts.
- **Next:** short rewrite now; full guide in 8b.
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey.

### O38. CONTRIBUTING out of date
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **What:** clone URL, submodule, PR workflow; "Adding a Physics Module" should become "add
  a process variant" (8b, O50).
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey; plan Phase 8.

### O39. `data/namelists/README.md` describes `clm-ml-offline`
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **What:** 121 lines on the retired executable (C30).
- **Next:** rewrite: the namelists are inputs of `clm-ml convert` and the Fortran
  comparison.
- **Source:** C30.

### O40. Namelists of unclear status
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** the four unused namelists deleted (decision 99).
- **What:** `nl.US-UMB.test` points to files in the maintainer's scratch (unusable by
  others; US-UMB is not a built-in tower, decision §8.9); `nl.CHATS7.debug` and
  `nl.CHATS7.test3` have no documented purpose.
- **Next:** keep, fix or delete each.
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey.

### O41. Example files not checked
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** `docs/design/examples/` removed (the global example was
  hypothetical); `configs/` replaces it and `tests/clm_ml/test_configs.py` (run in CI) checks
  every model.yaml is complete and current and every run.yaml loads.
- **What:** `docs/design/examples/run_global_example.yaml` fails `clm-ml check` (`domain:
  unknown key 'surface_dataset'`). The plan's risk table says `clm-ml check` runs in CI on
  every example; it does not.
- **Next:** fix or retire the example; CI check of every shipped config (with O17).
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey; plan §9.

### O42. Stale design documents
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **What:** plan header "Status: v4. Phases 0–2 done"; plan §8 rows 4-5 still "Undecided,
  revisit at Phase 7" (row 4 settled by C30; row 5 by Phase 7's `physics/soil.py`);
  `api_sketch.py` (proposed API, pre-implementation); numerics §4 titled "not changed in
  Phase 3"; `timing.md` holds only the Phase 0 baseline (later results only in
  `timing/*.jsonl`).
- **Next:** update or mark as historical.
- **Source:** Phase 8 survey; plan §8.

### O43. CI lint skips `timing/`
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **What:** CI runs `black`/`ruff` on `src/ tests/`; CLAUDE.md's lint command includes
  `timing`.
- **Source:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` l. 29-32.

### O44. One open-items list and one decision log
- **What:** decisions are spread over plan §0/§8, D1-D12, C0-C35, G1-G20 and the progress
  logs; open items over five files.
- **Next:** this document (open items) and a companion decision log; the old files keep
  their history.
- **Source:** maintainer request (2026-11-01).

### O65. `numerics.checkpoint_steps` does nothing
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **What:** the model.yaml key exists (`src/clm_ml/config.py:63`) but the driver always
  checkpoints the step (module constant `CHECKPOINT_STEP = True`, `src/clm_ml/driver.py:40`).
  A user setting it to false gets no effect and no warning.
- **Next:** remove the key, or make it work (it trades gradient memory for recomputation).
- **Source:** model map (2026-11-01).

### O66. PFT parameters used only at setup
- **What:** `root_profile_beta`, `c3_photosynthesis` and the PFT default canopy height and
  leaf/stem profiles are read once at setup (NumPy) into `PatchConstants`. Changing them in
  the parameters passed to `Model.run_chunk` has no effect, so a calibration of, say, the
  root profile would silently get zero gradient.
- **Next:** decide: document them as setup parameters, refuse them in calibration, or move
  the root fractions into the differentiable path.
- **Source:** model map (2026-11-01).

### O67. PFT optics in the old 1-based layout
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **What:** the spectral fields of `CanopyParams` (leaf/stem reflectance and transmittance)
  are `[unused, vis, nir]`; everything else is 0-based (decision on 0-based indexing).
- **Next:** convert (a refactor, bit for bit).
- **Source:** model map (2026-11-01).

### O68. Stale docstrings and comments
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **What:** the `model.py` header still shows "calendar-month chunks (decision 17)"
  (superseded by fixed-length chunks) and mentions several soil structures (C35);
  `clm_ml/__init__.py` says the public API "is re-exported here as it is built" (nothing
  is); CLAUDE.md said "Regression tolerance is `rtol = 1e-6`" (corrected 2026-11-01: the
  policy is bit for bit plus the noise twin).
- **Next:** correct them (with O42).
- **Source:** model map; decision register (2026-11-01).

### O69. Output accumulation differs from the plan's description
- **Closed 2026-11-01** (Phase 8a group C; see "Recently closed").
- **What:** the plan describes a nested scan (outer loop over output records, inner over
  steps); the code is one scan over steps, each step adding into a record slot chosen on
  the host. Memory still scales with output records, as intended.
- **Next:** update the plan text (no code change).
- **Source:** model map (2026-11-01).

### O70. Implement experiment folders
- **Closed 2026-11-01:** implemented (decision 91).
- **What:** decision 91: four complete files per experiment folder (`run`, `domain`, `model`,
  `params`), strict loading, `clm-ml new`/`upgrade`, presets in the package, `configs/`
  regenerated as folders, configuration copied into each run's output.
- **Next:** the six steps of `experiment_folders.md` §12 (questions answered, §13).
- **Source:** maintainer, 2026-11-01.

## 5. Documentation (Phase 9)

Moved from 8b to Phase 9 (decision 103). Done in 8b: `README.md` (install, run CHATS7),
`docs/how_the_model_works.md` (organization, skeleton, differences from Fortran),
`examples/run_tower.py` and `examples/run_global.py`.

### O45. Getting-started guide
YAML first: install, convert a namelist, run one CHATS7 day, read the netCDF with xarray,
first plot. **Source:** plan Phase 8.

### O46. Reference of every YAML key, generated from the code
The settings' explanations are code comments; move them (with units and Fortran names) into
the dataclass fields' metadata, generate the reference, test it stays current (8a code
part, bit for bit). **Source:** plan Phase 8; plan §9 ("key reference generated").

### O47. Examples
Gradient calibration (twin experiment or CHATS observations: maintainer's choice; data
files needed for the latter), ensemble (`vmap` over parameters), multi-tower/multi-patch, a
grid run; short versions run in CI. **Source:** plan Phase 8.

### O48. Page for Fortran CLM-ml users
Namelist keys and option codes to YAML, generated from the converter's tables
(`clm_ml/io/namelist.py`, `config.to_fortran_codes`). **Source:** plan Phase 8.

### O49. API reference from docstrings
Plus a pass over docstrings still worded in legacy terms. Depends on O21. **Source:** plan
Phase 8.

### O50. CONTRIBUTING
"Add a process variant" replaces "mirror the Fortran module"; testing tiers; regression
policy (bit for bit, noise twin). **Source:** plan Phase 8.

### O51. Output caveats for users
`soil_water_stress` (`btran`) is 1 everywhere with the WUE stomatal scheme (water stress
acts through leaf water potential, as Fortran); layer outputs are NaN above a patch's top
layer; `stem_area_added` (decision 30). **Source:** `global_input.md` regional test; CLAUDE.md
gotchas; G20.

### O52. Release 1.0.0
Version, CHANGELOG, `CITATION.cff` (O23), tag (O24). **Source:** plan Phase 8.

## 6. Deferred to after Phase 8

### O53. Round-off amplification in real 1° patches
A 1e-15 change of LAI moves latent heat by up to ~8 W m⁻² after sunrise in some patches
(largest: needleleaf, CLM6 `dleaf`): a discrete switch somewhere. Limits grid regression
tests to the night; will matter for gradients. Locate it routine by routine. **Source:**
`global_input.md` issue 10; plan "After Phase 8: science issues".

### O54. Bare-ground patches
No bare-ground path; the minimum plant area keeps such patches as sparse canopies (small
bias). Options written up (preferred: a canopy that behaves correctly as plant area → 0).
New code. **Source:** `global_input.md` issue 13; decision 29; plan "After Phase 8".

### O55. GPU performance
Kernel count per step (Phase 6 step 1c), C3/C4 groups traced twice in mixed batches
(decision 22, D10), the decision-33 GPU check, a full-year global run; a chunk is 11 %
slower than in Phase 6b (program 2.32 GB → 4 MB, compile 840 s → 61 s in Phase 7).
**Source:** plan "After Phase 8: GPU performance"; D10; `phase7_progress.md` timing.

### O56. Unsupported variants
Well-mixed flux profile and dataset profiles (fail on traced layer counts), Norman solar
radiation, Brent's method for the WUE optimization: registered, refused; make them run
compiled and validate against Fortran. **Source:** plan "After Phase 8: unsupported
variants"; D8; C13, C16, C17, C34; issue 18.

### O57. Option B: shared soil columns
`soil.columns: shared` (refused today, `config.py:110`); a separate science change,
validated at mixed-vegetation towers. **Source:** plan §6.7, "After Phase 8: option B";
decision 5.

### O58. Orbital parameters of the start year only
CLM's historical runs update them each year (~0.02° of declination over 150 years).
**Source:** decision 34; D4.

### O59. Forcing preprocessed once to model-step files
For repeated runs over the same years (calibration, ensembles, spin-up); saves CPU time
only. **Source:** decision 36.

### O60. Reduced-precision option
float32 for consumer GPUs (float64 30-60× slower there); never done; needs its own
validation. **Source:** plan §8 row 7.

## 7. Known model limitations (not to be fixed without discussion)

### O61. Strongly stable conditions
Near-ground air several degrees too warm: first-order closure cannot represent non-local
within-canopy mixing. **Source:** CLAUDE.md; Bonan et al. (2026).

### O62. Daytime latent heat biased high
By about 70 W m⁻² at CHATS. **Source:** CLAUDE.md; Bonan et al. (2026).

### O63. Soil heat flux biased high
The point measurement is likely unrepresentative. **Source:** CLAUDE.md.

### O64. Soil moisture prescribed, not predicted
**Source:** CLAUDE.md; plan decision 14.

  (O67), Euler tableau weight b = [1] (O33) (decision 94). Diagnosed, for the maintainer:
  O29, O30, O31 (above).

- One way to say each setting (`processes`, choice keys, named fallbacks; `clm-ml check`
  shows where each value comes from); organic matter required (O2) (decision 93; 2026-11-01).

- Soil texture classes take their own values (O1, issue 21; decision 92; 2026-11-01).

- Experiment folders implemented: four complete files, `clm-ml new`/`upgrade`, presets,
  configuration copy with each run's output (O70; decision 91; 2026-11-01).

- Configuration files: `configs/` with complete, generated model.yaml files; complete params
  files, `run.yaml` must name one (O17, O41; decisions 89, 90; 2026-11-01).

- One open-items list (this document), one decision register (`decisions.md`) and a map of
  the model (`model_overview.md`) (O44; maintainer request, 2026-11-01).

- CLM4.5 soil layer structure dropped; CLM soil only (decision 37, C35; also closes Phase 6
  review R8).
- Stray `lat.npy` deleted (C35).
- psihat tables an input of the compiled chunk (C22).
- Calendar: `time.calendar: gregorian | noleap` (decision 34; issue 2, review R2).
- Meteorology memory: forcing stays prepared on the host (decision 36; issue 7).
- Canopy energy balance when the air crosses freezing (decision 32; issue 12, except O6).
- Diffuse transmittance above 1 in thin layers (decision 30; issue 14).
- `wue_solver: brent` refused instead of silently ignored (C16; issue 18; see O19, O56).
- Phase 6 review: R1 (refused), R3, R6, R9 fixed (2026-10-30).
- Template compiled into programs as constants (C23 b; fixed in 7.4).
- Probably closed, to confirm in 8a: issue 8 (`forc_hgt_u_patch` written by the step: the
  containers were deleted in 7.4f; no `forc_hgt_u` in the step code); issue 11 (CPU cache
  loader crash of the batched first-step program: that program no longer exists since C28,
  and `without_persistent_cache_on_cpu` is gone from the code).
