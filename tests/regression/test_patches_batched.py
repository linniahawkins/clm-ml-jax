"""
Phase 6 step 3 test: many gridcells and patches in one run.

A domain of two gridcells and three patches, every per-patch field different:

- ``SITEA`` (CHATS7's location and soil) with two patches: the CHATS7 walnut (weight 0.6) and
  a needleleaf evergreen tree (weight 0.4) with its own canopy height, root biomass, leaf and
  stem profiles and explicit layer counts;
- ``SITEB`` (another latitude, longitude, bedrock depth, soil colour and texture) with one
  walnut patch with explicit layer counts.

All three read CHATS7's forcing files. One run of the domain (the step batched over the
patches) is compared with each patch run alone (a one-patch tower):

- every patch's output equals its run alone (round-off: separately compiled programs);
- the gridcell outputs are the area-weighted sums of the patches, for the mean and for the
  maximum (accumulated at every step inside the run, so the hourly maximum of the gridcell is
  the maximum of the weighted sum, not the weighted sum of the maxima);
- listing the gridcells and patches in another order reorders the outputs only.
