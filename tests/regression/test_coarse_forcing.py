"""
A configurable model step with interpolated forcing (decision 13), end to end: CHATS7 forced
by 6-hourly means of its own half-hourly data, run at a 30-minute model step, against the
normal half-hourly-forced run. The forcing is interpolated back to 30 minutes
(clm_ml.forcing_interpolation), so the daily incoming shortwave is conserved; the fluxes differ
because variability within 6 hours (clouds, the exact timing of temperature changes) is lost.
